# cub3_42
My first RayCaster with miniLibX
<h1><strong>‚úèÔ∏è cub3D : </strong></h1>
<p><i>This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way. </i><p>
<p><i>This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash. <br> You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.</i></p><br>
<h1>üí° Goal : </h1>
<p>This project‚Äôs objectives are similar to all this first year‚Äôs objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc. <br>
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc. <br>
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/109752/en.subject.pdf">Subject</a></p>
<h3>Mandatory Part:</h3>
<pre>      make</pre>
<p>How to play: </p>
<pre>      ./cub3D ./path_of_the_level</pre>
<p>ex :</p>
<pre>      ./cub3D levels/horror.cub</pre>
<ul>
  <li>The <- and -> arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and right in the maze</li>
  <li>The W, A, S and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through the maze.</li>
  <li>The ESC key and red cross close the window and quit the program cleanly.</li>  
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Part :</h3>
    <pre>      make bonus</pre>
    <pre>      ./cub3D_bonus ./path_of_the_level</pre>
    <p>ex :</p>
    <pre>      ./cub3D_bonus levels/pacman.cub</pre>
    <p>The keys are the same as mandatory part in addition we have : </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rotate the point of view with the mouse with left and right of the mouse</li>
      <li>SPACE for the gun</li>
    </ul>
